👋 Hi, I’m Ali Rezk  
👀 I’m interested in object-oriented programming (OOP), and I really enjoyed learning and applying it in my projects. I'm also passionate about web development and system design.  
🌱 I’m currently learning Data structure and alogrithms, full-stack web development with React and Next.js, and database management using SQL and MongoDB.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development or OOP-based applications.  
📫 How to reach me: ali.rezk020@gmail.com
